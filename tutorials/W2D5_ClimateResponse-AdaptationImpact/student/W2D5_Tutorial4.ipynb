The Chatify notebook extension adds support for a large language model-based \"coding tutor\" to the materials. The tutor provides automatically generated text to help explain any code cell in this notebook.\n",

If you wish to proceed by installing and enabling the Chatify extension, you should run the next two code blocks (hidden by default). If you do *not* want to use this experimental version of the Climatematch materials, please use the [stable](https://compclimate.neuromatch.io/) materials instead.\n",

    "To use the Chatify helper, insert the `%%explain` magic command at the start of any code cell and then run it (shift + enter) to access an interface for receiving LLM-based assitance. You can then select different options from the dropdown menus depending on what sort of assitance you want.  To disable Chatify and run the code block as usual, simply delete the `%%explain` command and re-run the cell.\n",
