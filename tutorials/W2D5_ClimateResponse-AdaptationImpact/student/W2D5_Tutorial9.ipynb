The tutor provides automatically generated text to help explain any code cell in this notebook.\n",

If you wish to proceed by installing and enabling the Chatify extension, you should run the next two code blocks (hidden by default). If you do *not* want to use this experimental version of the Climatematch materials, please use the [stable](https://compclimate.neuromatch.io/) materials instead.\n",

To disable Chatify and run the code block as usual, simply delete the `%%explain` command and re-run the cell.\n",
